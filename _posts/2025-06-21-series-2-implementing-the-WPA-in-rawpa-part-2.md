What's up, everyone? I'm back with Part 2 on implementing the Web Penetration Assistant (WPA) logic in RAWPA. Last time, we talked about the initial steps, and now, I've got some major updates to share.

When I first started this project, my main goal was to lock down the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). For me, that meant getting the straight-up, no-frills methodologies in place. A simple, linear guide for testers. After getting that down, I moved on to the "Guided" methodology, and I'm proud to announce I just wrapped up the first version of the "Pathway" feature!

I'll be real with you, though. It needs a lot of improvement. I had this super clear picture of how it would function in my mind, but somewhere along the way, I completely lost my train of thought, lol. It happens, right? Still, it's a solid foundation to build on. Here’s a peek at what the pathway looks like right now:

This whole project has been such a learning experience, and not just in coding. It's teaching me so much about communication and connecting with people on similar career paths, and honestly, it's been amazing. The community aspect is something I didn't expect but still incredibly grateful for.

Now for the exciting part: we're officially moving into the testing stage!

I've pretty much nailed the core MVPs of RAWPA. The main AI using RAG is still a bit off, lol, but don't hesitate—I'll get that sorted out soon. For now, the key features are ready for some real-world feedback.

I sent out a few messages to some security groups and communities, and the response was great. We now have our first 11 users willing to test RAWPA and be early access users! It might seem like a small number to some, but if RAWPA helps even just one of them, I know I’ve done something great.

To make this happen, I just recently pushed the project to Vercel. It's now live! It took me a solid hour of battling with build issues, but we made it, and it's up and running.

That's all the updates for now. Thanks for following the journey.

And I'm out ✌️
