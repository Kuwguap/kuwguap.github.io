  <summary>Hey everyone, it’s been a minute!  Welcome back to the devlog for RAWPA. After laying down the initial groundwork and figuring out “so, what now?”, I’ve been deep in the trenches turning the concept into a functional tool. This next series of posts is all about the journey of implementing the Web Pentesting Assistant (WPA), and let me tell you, it’s been a ride.  A Glimpse into the Future  One ...</summary>

  <summary>Hey everyone,  I’m excited to share a project I’ve been pouring my energy into lately: Blossom, a voice-enabled mental health companion designed to help us all reflect, cope, and grow emotionally. And guess what? I recently submitted Blossom to its very first hackathon!  From Idea to (Almost) Reality  The idea for Blossom sparked from recognizing a real need in our often-hectic lives. We all fa...</summary>

  <summary>Alright, picking up where we left off in the last post, it’s time to dive into the visual side of things. As I mentioned, the core of this project is building a tool to help streamline the penetration testing workflow, and that means designing an interface that’s both intuitive and efficient.  My first step was wireframing. I initially started with Balsamiq, thinking its simplicity would be a g...</summary>

  <summary>Well, here we go. Putting thoughts down “on paper” – or rather, onto a digital page that anyone with an internet connection can stumble upon. It feels a little… exposed, to be honest. For a while now, the hum in the back of my mind has been getting louder, a persistent buzz of wanting to build something. Something that scratches a particular itch I’ve felt throughout my journey in the security ...</summary>
