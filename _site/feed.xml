  <summary>So, you’ve landed the engagement. The scope is defined, the rules of engagement are set, and the target is locked: GravexLabs. You have the name, and that’s it. This is the starting point for every offensive security operation, a blank canvas that, through skill and methodology, will be painted into a detailed map of attack surfaces, endpoints, and potential vulnerabilities.  This isn’t just ab...</summary>

  <summary>Hey internet, you’re not going to believe this. RAWPA gained a brain.  I’ve hardly been sleeping, pushing code and chasing ideas. Yesterday, I finally crashed for about six solid hours, and guess what? The idea for the new Pathway Methodology hit me like a bag of bricks. LOL.  I saw it vividly—exactly what the next evolution of RAWPA needed to be. And for those wondering, this isn’t that initia...</summary>

  <summary>Hey internet, this is RAWPA, RAWPA internet!  Man, the journey of building RAWPA has been a rollercoaster of code, coffee, and some seriously insightful conversations. I recently had a chat with a fellow pentester that completely lit up the path forward for RAWPA’s development. You know I’m all about getting this tool into your hands for testing, so when inspiration strikes, I gotta act fast.6 ...</summary>

  <summary>What’s up, everyone? I’m back with Part 2 on implementing the Web Penetration Assistant (WPA) logic in RAWPA. Last time, we talked about the initial steps, and now, I’ve got some major updates to share.  When I first started this project, my main goal was to lock down the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). For me, that meant getting the straight-up, no-frills methodologies in place. A simple, linear...</summary>

  <summary>Hey everyone, it’s been a minute!  Welcome back to the devlog for RAWPA. After laying down the initial groundwork and figuring out “so, what now?”, I’ve been deep in the trenches turning the concept into a functional tool. This next series of posts is all about the journey of implementing the Web Pentesting Assistant (WPA), and let me tell you, it’s been a ride.  A Glimpse into the Future  One ...</summary>
